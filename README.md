# Text File Conversion

This mini project focuses on converting a text file from one format to another using Python. Specifically, it converts a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file to a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file.

## Conversion Process

The project includes a function `csv_to_json` that performs the conversion. It takes a CSV file path and a JSON file path as inputs. The function reads the CSV file, converts the CSV data to a list of dictionaries, and then writes the converted data to the JSON file.

## Usage

1. Provide the file paths for the input CSV file and the desired output JSON file in the code:
   ```python
   csv_file_path = 'input.csv'
   json_file_path = 'output.json'

## Example
   ```python
   name,age,email
   John,25,john@example.com
   Emily,30,emily@example.com'
